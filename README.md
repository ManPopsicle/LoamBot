# LoamBot
Discord bot for Sandy Loam's Discord server. Mostly here to make streaming cartoons easier.

# Setup
1. Make a Discord Bot (HOW TO MAKE A DISCORD BOT: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html). Bot will need read/write text channel permissions, including links, attachments and emojis, and message management. 
2. Clone this repo with ``git clone https://github.com/ManPopsicle/LoamBot.git`` or download the zip from Github.
3. Navigate to LoamBot directory
4. Install dependencies with ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``
5. Rename the ``config.yaml.example`` file to ``config.yaml`` and fill out the credentials (Remember to turn on Developer mode in Discord to get your UserID for the config!)
6. Run the bot with ``python3 Loambot.py`` or ``python Loambot.py`` or ``py Loambot.py``
